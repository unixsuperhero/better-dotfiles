DESCRIPTION  :
  This script will be used to generate different types of files.  The files it
generates typically contain source code.  Source files often require specific
elements and formats.  This script prepopulates the new file with these required
elements.  As well as, common but optional elements, for convenience.

  This script will be used to make different types of new files, prepopulated
with the required elements for that file type.  As well as, common but optional
elements.

  This script generates new files
