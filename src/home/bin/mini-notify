# GROWLNOTIFY(1)		  BSD General Commands Manual		GROWLNOTIFY(1)
# 
# NAME      growlnotify -- send a notification to Growl
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#      growlnotify [-hsvuwc] [-i ext] [-I filepath] [--image filepath]
# 		 [-a appname] [-p priority] [-H host] [-P password]
# 		 [--port port] [-n name] [-A method] [--progress value]
# 		 [-m message] [-t] [title]
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#      growlnotify posts a distributed notification to Growl.
# 
#      -n, --name name
# 		 Sets the application name to register the notification under.
# 		 By default 'growlnotify' is used.
# 
#      title	 The title of the notification.
# 
#      -t, --title
#      Verbosely say that the next arg is the title
# 
#      -m, --message message
# 		 Uses message instead of stdin as the notification message
# 		 (also called description).  If message is '-', stdin is still
# 		 used.
#
#      -p, --priority priority
#      If -p is used then priority can be an int between -2 and 2 or can be a
#      named key in the following list: Very Low, Moderate, Normal,
#      High, Emergency. (default is 0).
# 
# 		 Priority is not supported by all displays, so this may be
# 		 ignored.
# 
#      -s, --sticky
# 		 Causes the notification to stick around until clicked.
# 
#      -w, --wait  Causes growlnotify to wait until the notification is dis-
# 		 missed (either by clicking or timing out) before it returns.
# 
#      --progress  Set a progress value for this notification.
# 
# EXAMPLES
# 	   % growlnotify --help     # Displays this help file.
# 
# 	   growlnotify --appIcon Xcode Build complete -m 'growlnotify has finished building'

## [ Image Related Options ]
#      -a, --appIcon name
# 		 Sets the notification's application icon to the icon for the
# 		 given application name. If you don't specify a notification
# 		 icon, this will be used instead of it; if you specify both,
# 		 the application icon may be used as a badge (that is, dis-
# 		 played in a corner of the notification icon, superimposed on
# 		 top of it), or the display may show both separately.
# 
# 		 Icons are not supported by all displays, so this may be
# 		 ignored.
# 
#      -i, --icon ext
# 		 Sets the notification icon to the default icon for the given
# 		 extension or HFS-encoded file type. For example, -i mp3 and
# 		 -i 'MP3 ' (note the space in the second example) will both
# 		 use the icon for MP3 files.
# 
# 		 Icons are not supported by all displays, so this may be
# 		 ignored.
# 
#      -I, --iconpath path
# 		 Sets the notification icon to the given file's icon (the icon
# 		 you would see in the Finder if you were looking at the file).
# 
# 		 Icons are not supported by all displays, so this may be
# 		 ignored.
# 
#      --image path
# 		 Sets the notification icon to contents of the given image
# 		 file. As of Mac OS X 10.3, this file must be in PNG, JPEG,
# 		 TIFF, PICT, PDF, JPEG 2000, Adobe Photoshop, BMP, .ico, or
# 		 .icns format. If the image data is in a format Growl doesn't
# 		 recognize, the notification will still go through, and the
# 		 icon will be ignored.
# 
# 		 Icons are not supported by all displays, so this may be
# 		 ignored anyway.
