DESCRIPTION  :
  I forgot what I was really going to do with this test.  Something along the
lines of:

  - Compare [$]* vs. [$]@
  - Compare shift vs. getopt vs. getopts
  - Loop through all the args passed to the script.
  - Use 'shift' while looping to identify switches plus any args after them that
    they are supposed to use.  (eg. tar -t -f [/path/to/file_for_the_-f_arg])

TODO         :
  Write the script... =p

META

## Start writing the script here:

# ^_~


for a in "$@"
do
  cat << ----YAYO----
  YAYO Doing something fun here: $a
----YAYO----
done

#CAT <<CODE
#running declare
#$(declare)
#end running declare
#CODE


cat <<TODO &>/dev/null

  A command that could be used for this test is my (dict) command:

/home/jearsh/bin/dict

  Right now it only uses [$]1.  It could be expanded to define all of the words
passed as arguments, AND expanded to accept switches.  I'm not sure what the
switches would be.  But it could use some.

TODO
